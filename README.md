# What does it do?

Whenever you need to calculate some time in the future or the past or between two dates counting only business days, look no further.

The Business Days Calculator counts a business day as a week day (excluding weekends) and also excluding federal government holidays.

## How does it work?

In the first box, you can enter two dates and it will return how many business days fall between those dates.

In the second box you can enter a start date and a number of business days to count forward and it will return the end date.

In the third box, you can enter an end date and a number of business days backward and it will return the start date.
